Creators build. Players play. The chain pays.
A sleek, creator-first web3 game launchpad on Sui â€” where UGC, fair finance, and awesome gameplay meet.

ðŸš€ TL;DR

Leviathan is a Sui-native web3 game launchpad that empowers creators to build, customize, publish, and monetize on-chain-ready games â€” while protecting users from SUI volatility via Hermit Finance (hSui).
This repo contains the MVP blueprint: hSui swap, Salmon Launchpad (5Ã—5 Yut-style board editor), Splash Zone (game browser + PvP), and the lightweight off-chain systems to make gameplay smooth.

âœ¨ What makes it dope

Creator-first: No deep Move knowledge required â€” low-code / no-code game editor and templates.

Hybrid architecture: responsive, low-latency off-chain gameplay + on-chain financial settlement & verifiable game registration.

Reliable finance: delta-neutral hSui LST protects players from raw SUI volatility while keeping composability.

One-click publish: package game metadata to Walrus/IPFS and register on-chain with hSui fees.

MVP focus: ship fast, look polished, scale later.
