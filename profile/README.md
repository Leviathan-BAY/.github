Creators build. Players play. The chain pays.
A sleek, creator-first web3 game launchpad on Sui â€” where UGC, fair finance, and awesome gameplay meet.

ðŸš€ TL;DR

Leviathan is a Sui-native web3 game launchpad that empowers creators to build, customize, publish, and monetize on-chain-ready games â€” while protecting users from SUI volatility via Hermit Finance (hSui).
